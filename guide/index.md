# Basic guide to installation and use of Zotero

## Installing Zotero

1. First, install the latest version of the **Mozilla Firefox** browser. 
- If you already have Firefox on your computer, then check for the latest update. In Firefox, go to Firefox --\> About Firefox and install updates if given the option.
- If you do not have Firefox on your computer, then download the latest version from the [Firefox web site][1].

2. Next, install **Zotero** as an extension for the Firefox browser. From within Firefox, go to the [Zotero home page][2] and click on the big red "Download Now" button.

3. Then click on "Zotero 4.0 for Firefox."

4. Zotero will ask you to register your Zotero account by creating a user name and password. Don't skip this step! You'll need a Zotero account to sync your library to the cloud. After you register you may have to validate your account through a link sent to your email.

5. OK, last installation step. Now you'll install the plugin that allows Zotero to create citations and bibliographies right in your paper. Go back to the [Zotero download page][3]. This time, click on the link labeled "Add a plugin for Word or LibreOffice" under the "Zotero 4.0 for Firefox" button you pushed before. Choose the appropriate plugin for your operating system and word processor.

## Setting initial preferences

5. Click the Zotero icon in the lower right corner of Firefox. This opens Zotero in a pane in the bottom half of your browser. If you want to see Zotero as a full screen, click the icon labeled that looks like a tab with a right-pointing arrow in the upper-right corner of the Zotero frame.

6. Now click the gear icon (third from the left in the Zotero pane. A menu will appear. Click on the menu for Preferences.

![Gear icon][image-5]

![Preferences window][image-6]

8. Now click the "Sync" icon. Enter your username and password and check off the boxes for "Sync automatically" and "Sync attachment files…." Once this step is complete, any references you import in this session will be automatically transferred via Zotero's cloud storage to any other computer on which you install Zotero in the future.

8. Last preference to set: default citation style. Click the "Cite" icon and then the "Styles" button. You'll see a list of all the citation styles that are currently installed. If the style you need is not on the list, you'll need to add it yourself. Click the link to "Get additional styles..." In the search box enter a word or two from the style you're looking for. When you find the right style, click on the link next to it to install the style.

Some departments and their preferred style:

- Chemistry: American Chemical Society  
- Environmental Science: Council of Science Editors (author-date)  

Next time you open this preference screen, your new style will appear as an option.

## Collecting References

5. Now we'll create a new collection for the references you're about to import. Look at the left side of the Zotero pane. The folder icon on the upper left will allow you to create new collections of notes and sources. This is how you organize your items.

In Zotero your have one *library* that is organized into several *collections*. Collections are represented by folder icons. But, unlike with paper folders you may put an item into more than one collection. Right now create a collection for the topic of interest that you will be researching. Keep this new collection selected and any new items you import will automatically be added to it.

![New Collections icon][image-9]

6. Now you will find articles or other sources to add to your Zotero library. From within Firefox, go to a database (Feinberg library databases include JSTOR, Web of Science, Science Direct, etc.) or Google Scholar and browse or search on a topic.

7. Once an article of interest is located, look at the address bar at the top of your browser. You'll see an icon at the right edge of the address bar. It probably looks like a piece of paper; it might look like a folder, or an open book. This icon will add the item in your browser to your Zotero library. Zotero knows what kind of item you are looking at -- an article, a book, or even a search results page with many articles listed -- and will show the icon that best represents that item. 

Click the icon. You'll see the item appear in your Zotero library. Give it a minute to download and click the small triangle on the left side of the item in the library. This will show a dropdown with the .pdf of your article (if it has one) automatically downloaded. 

If the icon does not show up in the address bar, back out of the browser URL w/ the back arrow one step and likely one will appear and a dialogue box will open allowing you to select the article from the list to catalog.

9. You are able to make detailed notes that are linked to a specific reference using the "Notes" tab. Clicked on a reference in your library, and the window below becomes visible and you can make notes on a reference you are reading (like the old school index card method).

10. When done with citation selection, click on the green curled arrow icon (sync) on right of Zotero at bottom to sync articles. It may prompt you to log in.

2. In the MS Word toolbar the cogà CSE (author-date) is listedà select ità accept as default (allow title abbreviations…this is the default setting) for document preferences.

3. Type a paraphrased sentence in MS Word and highlight the citation in the Zotero library that you would like to internally cite. Click the Insert citations icon (first one on left) in the Word Zotero toolbar. They should format as CSE formatting. Continue writing the paper and selecting appropriate internal references. (Alternatively, click this and search for those articles from the library and they can insert.)

![insert citation][image-17]

4. When done for the day, click on the Zotero bibliography creator icon (3 from left in Zotero toolbar in Word). This will create a bibliography at the end of the paper formatted in CSE (author-date) style.

![Create bibliography][image-18]

5. Save your document.

**Note**: when attempting to start a sentence with the citation (instead of ending w/ it), in an effort to alter sentence structure, one can click the insert citation icon, type the authors name or article title, double click in the red window on the citation name for a dialogue box and **select to suppress the author name.** This will allow the year to show up in parentheses and the entry to be added to the bibliography.

**Dickinson et al. (2010) noted….** (insert box/image indicating that only 2010 is linked to Zotero)

![Insert page number][image-19]

6. When you are ready to turn in your final draft, you may choose to remove the links in your document. You can do this by clicking on the broken link icon on the far right of the custom toolbar. This will convert your document into plain text. Remember to save a version that includes the links in case you want to edit the paper in the future.
